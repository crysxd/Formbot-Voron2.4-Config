# Formbot Voron 2.4 R2 Pro+

This is a basic config for the Formbot Voron 2.4 R2 Pro+ with instructions as a PDF file. I build the entire machine on stream:

You can follow the streams and build along, but also keep an eye on the [PDF guide](https://github.com/crysxd/Voron2.4-Config/blob/main/Build%20Guide.pdf) as I e.g. later in the streams found out something could have been done better. It also goes into more detail on flashing the CB1, M8P and SB2209 and contains a list with things you need to print. You can also use my Orca Project files in the STL folder.


If you plan to buy this kit please consider to use my affiliate link so I get a small kick back :)
