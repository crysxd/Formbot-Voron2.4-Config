# Formbot Voron 2.4 R2 Pro+

This is a basic config for the Formbot Voron 2.4 R2 Pro+ with instructions as a PDF file. I build the entire machine on stream:

You can follow the streams and build along, but also keep an eye on the PDF guide as I e.g. later in the streams found out something could have been done better.


If you plan to buy this kit please consider to use my affiliate link so I get a small kick back :)
